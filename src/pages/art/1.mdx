**1. Improved**
Students who meditate are better able to control their attention (Chambers et al, 2008; Zenner et al, 2014), with less mind-wandering (Rahl et al, 2017).

**2. Fewer distractions, better focus**
Mindfulness meditation helps individuals focus, for example, reducing “mindless reading” where they’re scanning the text without really absorbing the meaning (Zanesco et al, 2016).

**3. Concentrate for longer**
Mindfulness meditation also improves performance on tasks that need a concentration span over a long time (Jha et al, 2011).
