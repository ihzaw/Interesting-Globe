Everyone is able to carry out learning activities, but only those who master effective and efficient learning methods are able to absorb learning outcomes better.
# So, how do you study effectively and efficiently?

# 1. Set goals 
If you want to learn effectively and efficiently is started by setting goals or targets. 
For example, your study goal is to enter a well-known university. By entering the college, you must have grades that are
certainly qualified. Therefore, set goals that are as significant as possible to
boost your enthusiasm. For example, like the semester exam, aim to get
a minimum of 80 for Mathematics. Setting goals can be a source of motivation if
you start to feel like you're losing interest in studying. Having clear goals
helps you stay focused and consistent throughout the learning process.

<br />

# 2. Arrange Study Schedule
The second effective and efficient way to study is to arrange your study schedule. In this case you must be disciplined in obeying your study hours. For example, from 7 pm to 8 pm you have to study. Don't forget to rest for 5-10 minutes while you're studying.
Studying every day is one of the keys so that your learning results are absorbed more into the brain, compared to learning with a speeding system last night. Even if you only spend 20 minutes studying, it's better than nothing.

<br />

# 3. Create a Comfortable Learning Atmosphere
Create a comfortable learning atmosphere so you can stay focused on studying. Some people are used to a quiet atmosphere and not many distractions, so they can study in a quiet library or cafe.  
However, there is also someone who learns to absorb more quickly while listening to music. It all depends on you, get to know yourself and make the learning atmosphere as comfortable as possible.

<br />

# 4. Create Summary
The next effective and efficient way to study is by making a summary of your learning outcomes. You can write down the main points. It can be points from your study material in a book, such as formulas. It will be easy to understand the essence of the lesson.  
When making a summary, you are actually repeating the material that has been obtained. This repetition helps you recall notes more effectively. Try copying notes before a test or exam to help you remember the material better.  
Don't forget to make a summary with sentences that you make yourself. Writing the material in sentences that you make up yourself will help you better remember the important points you have learned.

<br />

# 5. Make an Easy to Remember Acronym
Using an acronym that is easy to remember can make it easier for you to remember your learning outcomes. For example, everyone remembers what FYI means because it's short and concise and easy to remember

<br />

# 6. Understand, Not Memorize
Some people are wrong in learning on this matter. Often a person even memorizes the material instead of understanding it. In fact, just memorizing lessons will only be effective for exams or short term time. In the long run, memorized knowledge will only be easy to forget and will not leave any benefit.

<br />

# 7. Don't be shy to ask
Don't hesitate to ask questions if we don't understand something or experience a deadlock in a subject. You learn because you really don't understand, so if you have trouble, don't hesitate to always ask. You can ask your friends, study together or discussions can also make learning more fun.

<br />

# 8. Never give up
If you've done everything and still haven't reached your target, it doesn't mean you failed. Remember that you will never succeed if you don't make mistakes. Stay confident and keep trying.
Stay calm and never give up. There are no shortcuts in life. Likewise with chasing a dream, there is no shortcut to achieve your dream. So never give up to keep learning.
<br />
# Well, that's it for effective and efficient ways of learning that you can do. Have a good study!
